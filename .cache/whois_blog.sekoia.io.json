The data in this record is provided by Identity Digital or the Registry Operator for informational purposes only, and accuracy is not guaranteed. This service is intended only for query-based access. You agree that you will use this data only for lawful purposes and that, under no circumstances will you use this data to (a) allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission by e-mail, telephone, or facsimile of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitations to entities other than the data recipient's own existing customers; or (b) enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that send queries or data to the systems of Registry Operator, a Registrar, or Identity Digital except as reasonably necessary to register domain names or modify existing registrations. When using the Whois service, please consider the following: The Whois service is not a replacement for standard EPP commands to the SRS service. Whois is not considered authoritative for registered domain objects. The Whois service may be scheduled for downtime during production or OT&E maintenance periods. Queries to the Whois services are throttled. If too many queries are received from a single IP address within a specified time, the service will begin to reject further queries for a period of time to prevent disruption of Whois service access. Abuse of the Whois system through data mining is mitigated by detecting and limiting bulk query access from single sources. Where applicable, the presence of a [Non-Public Data] tag indicates that such data is not made publicly available due to applicable data privacy laws or requirements. Should you wish to contact the registrant, please refer to the Whois records available through the registrar URL listed above. Access to non-public data may be provided, upon request, where it can be reasonably confirmed that the requester holds a specific legitimate interest and a proper legal basis for accessing the withheld data. Access to this data provided by Identity Digital can be requested by submitting a request via the form found at https://www.identity.digital/about/policies/whois-layered-access/. The Registrar of Record identified in this output may have an RDDS service that can be queried for additional information on how to contact the Registrant, Admin, or Tech contact of the queried domain name. Identity Digital Inc. and Registry Operator reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. By submitting this query, you agree to abide by this policy.\r\nDomain Name: sekoia.io\nRegistry Domain ID: D503300000040465232-LRMS\nRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.gandi.net\nRegistrar URL: http://www.gandi.net\nUpdated Date: 2025-07-18T11:10:22Z\nCreation Date: 2017-04-18T22:30:01Z\nRegistrar Registration Expiration Date: 2026-04-19T00:30:14Z\nRegistrar: GANDI SAS\nRegistrar IANA ID: 81\nRegistrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@support.gandi.net\nRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +33.170377661\nReseller: \nDomain Status: clientTransferProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited\nDomain Status: \nDomain Status: \nDomain Status: \nDomain Status: \nRegistry Registrant ID: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\nRegistrant Name: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\nRegistrant Organization: SEKOIA\nRegistrant Street: 63-65 boulevard Massena\nRegistrant City: Paris\nRegistrant State/Province: Paris\nRegistrant Postal Code: 75013\nRegistrant Country: FR\nRegistrant Phone: +33.170377666\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\nRegistrant Fax: +33.143730576\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\nRegistrant Email: 1846ab233f33a6cd23ce1773f7c09d14-5360463@contact.gandi.net\nRegistry Admin ID: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\nAdmin Name: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\nAdmin Organization: SEKOIA\nAdmin Street: 63-65 boulevard Massena\nAdmin City: Paris\nAdmin State/Province: Paris\nAdmin Postal Code: 75013\nAdmin Country: FR\nAdmin Phone: +33.170377666\nAdmin Phone Ext:\nAdmin Fax: +33.143730576\nAdmin Fax Ext:\nAdmin Email: 1846ab233f33a6cd23ce1773f7c09d14-5360463@contact.gandi.net\nRegistry Tech ID: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\nTech Name: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\nTech Organization: SEKOIA\nTech Street: 63-65 boulevard Massena\nTech City: Paris\nTech State/Province: Paris\nTech Postal Code: 75013\nTech Country: FR\nTech Phone: +33.170377666\nTech Phone Ext:\nTech Fax: +33.143730576\nTech Fax Ext:\nTech Email: 1846ab233f33a6cd23ce1773f7c09d14-5360463@contact.gandi.net\nName Server: NS-118-A.GANDI.NET\nName Server: NS-110-B.GANDI.NET\nName Server: NS-196-C.GANDI.NET\nName Server: \nName Server: \nName Server: \nName Server: \nName Server: \nName Server: \nName Server: \nDNSSEC: Unsigned\nURL of the ICANN WHOIS Data Problem Reporting System: http://wdprs.internic.net/\n>>> Last update of WHOIS database: 2025-11-13T21:23:01Z <<<\n\nFor more information on Whois status codes, please visit\nhttps://www.icann.org/epp\n\nReseller Email: \nReseller URL: \n\nPersonal data access and use are governed by French law, any use for the purpose of unsolicited mass commercial advertising as well as any mass or automated inquiries (for any intent other than the registration or modification of a domain name) are strictly forbidden.
